Characters gain a class upon hitting certain skill thresholds so its about building adventure comps

Items are then suited to particular characters so theres a strategy between going between the items you have and the stats you get


Class differentiation probably needs some thought, currently just based on highest. Maybe also number of gains?


Adventurer: no stat more than 2 away from each other

How are missions simulated?
Encounters, enemies and turns.

Missions are made up of encounters which are made up of enemies.

Enemies and characters attack each other, doing damage to the highest health of each first (unless something like archers changes targeting). Attacks are simultaneous

Equipment: Class bound and can also be tripled

Adventures:
	How do I communicate how difficult an adventure is?
	Enemies

How does magic and mana work?

While a character has mana, they do damage to all enemies equal to their magic

Enemies always attack the first character in the party first so you can have tanks
